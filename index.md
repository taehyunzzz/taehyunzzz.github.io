Greetings! My name is Taehyun Kim and I am pursuing a Ph.D degree in ECE at Seoul National
University. Currently, I am a member of the Computer Architecture and Parallel Processing Lab
([CAPPLab](http://capp.snu.ac.kr/)) led by Professor Hyuk-Jae Lee.

It is thrilling to see how large-scale artificial intelligence has transformed the world in the
recent years. I am excited what they could potentially do in the upcoming years! As neural networks
continue to grow larger and larger, hardware constraints may limit the performance of SoTA algorithms.
My current research interests focus on resolving hardware limitations for emerging AI technologies
by realizing practical solutions for processing-in-memory (PIM) and near-data processing (NDP) for
large-scale Transformer models (vision & language & multi-modal).

I am looking forward to having discussions and collaborations regarding aligned research, so
please feel free to contact me through my contact channels!
