My name is Taehyun Kim and I am pursuing a Ph.D degree in ECE at Seoul National
University. Currently, I am a member of the Computer Architecture and Parallel Processing Lab
([CAPPLab](http://capp.snu.ac.kr/)) led by Professor Hyuk-Jae Lee.

It is fascinating to see how large-scale artificial intelligence has transformed the
world in the recent years. I am excited to see what they could potentially achieve in
the upcoming years! As neural networks continue to grow larger and larger, hardware
constraints may limit the performance of SoTA algorithms.
My current research interests focus on resolving such hardware limitations by realizing
practical solutions using processing-in-memory (PIM) and near-data processing (NDP).

I am looking forward to engaging in discussions and collaborations regarding aligned
research, so please feel free to contact me through my contact channels!
