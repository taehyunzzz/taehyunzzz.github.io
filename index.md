## About Me
My name is Taehyun Kim and I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree in ECE, Seoul National University. Currently, I am a member of the Computer Architecture and Parallel Processing Lab (CAPPLab) led by Professor Hyuk-Jae Lee. Before joining the research group, I received my B.S. degree from ECE, Seoul National University. My current research interests focus primarily on resolving hardware limitations on running large-scale AI models by applying system optimizations and designing practical processing-in-memory (PIM) / near-data processing (NDP) solutions. I look forward to engaging in discussions and collaborations regarding aligned research, so please feel free to contact me!

## Research Interests
- **Large Transformer Models:** Language, Vision, Multi-modal AI
- **Efficient AI:** Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT), Pruning, Quantization
- **Processing-in-Memory:** Processing-in-Memory (PIM) & near-data processing (NDP)
