My name is Taehyun Kim and I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree in ECE, Seoul National
University. Currently, I am a member of the Computer Architecture and Parallel
Processing Lab ([CAPPLab](http://capp.snu.ac.kr/)) led by Professor Hyuk-Jae Lee.
Before joining the research group, I received my B.S. degree from ECE, Seoul
National University.

My current research interests focus primarily on resolving current hardware
limitations on running large-scale AI models by applying system optimizations
and designing practical processing-in-memory (PIM) and near-data processing (NDP)
solutions.

I am looking forward to engaging in discussions and collaborations regarding aligned
research, so please feel free to contact me through my contact channels!
